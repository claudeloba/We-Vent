# School project
#### Build a website with focus on SCSS.
---

> The goal was to create a website that filled different criterias. We had to use scss and HTML.

I am happy with how it turned out design-wise, this project really helped me improve my UI/UX workflow.
Also, got to practice on some CSS animations, feel free to check the live site out here:
